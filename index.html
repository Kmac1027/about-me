        <li>Guitar</li>
        <li>Bass</li>
        <li>Piano</li>

        <li>and many others</li>
      </ul>
      <p>the instruments highlighted in yellow are my favorite to play</p>
      <p>I currently play in a hardcore/metal band called Deathbreaker. We are signed to Facedown Records and have just released our sophmore album with Facedown called "Isolate"</p>
      <p>I have spent the last several years on the road with Deathbreaker touring all over the country, we even had a European tour lined up for this year but Covid19 forced us to cancel all tours for the forseable future.</p>
