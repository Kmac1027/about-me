      <p>Hello, my name is Kevin McNeil and I am a musician</p>
      <p>I play several instruments including...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Guitar</li>
        <li>Bass</li>
        <li>Piano</li>
        <li>Bagpipes</li>

        <li>Penny Whistle</li>
        <li>Cello</li>
        <li>Violin</li>
        <li>and many others</li>
      </ul>
      <p>the instrument highlighted in green is my favorite to play</p><br>
      <p>I went to South Puget Sound Community College for Computer Network Administration, however i did not enjoy doing that so i quit that field and went into music full time. i have been a music teacher for several years as well as a full time musician almost all my life.</p>
      <p>I currently play in a hardcore/metal band called Deathbreaker. We are signed to Facedown Records and have just released our sophmore album with Facedown called "Isolate"</p><br>
      <p>I have spent the last five years on the road with Deathbreaker touring all over the country, we even had a European tour lined up for this year but Covid19 forced us to cancel all tours for the forseable future.</p><br>
